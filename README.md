# SpacePlugin

My first Spigot plugin, this adds some basic things such as doublejump, blasters, and jetpacks.

# THIS PLUGIN IS DEAD
I have decided to split this plugin into multiple plugins, as it is wayyy out of scope. This was originally intended to add all sorts of space-themed items and multiblocks, but as of now I do not have the experience to do that.  
  
Blasters have been cleaned up and packaged into [their own plugin](https://github.com/trainb0y1/BlasterPlugin)  
I finished up the jetpacks and fuel system partially implemented here. It is avalible [here](https://github.com/trainb0y1/SimpleJetpacks).
As for the doublejump, who needs yet another doublejump plugin? That dies with this project.
